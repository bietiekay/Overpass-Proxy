<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Diagnosing Redis Connection**

I need to figure out the Redis connection in Docker Compose. It seems likely that the service is running on port 6379, not 6380, and the address 127.0.0.1 isn't accessible from inside the container. I want to check the config.ts for reading environment variables, and I'll review the docker-compose.yml and README files. This will involve multiple steps, but they're manageable. I won't need a todo list for this. I'll provide a status update after checking those files.</details></think>

---

I'll check how Redis is configured in the code and Docker setup to see why it's connecting to 127.0.0.1:6380 inside the container. Then I'll propose the minimal fix.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Evaluating docker-compose setup**

I'm looking at the docker-compose setup where REDIS_URL is configured as redis://127.0.0.1:6380. However, inside the container, 127.0.0.1 refers to itself and not the host. I need to use the service name redis:6379; the default config is redis://redis:6379. I should change the docker-compose environment or drop the variable entirely. I'll document this in the README, and since this is a small edit, I should still follow up with the todo tool. I must also propose rebuilding the containers afterward.
**Implementing docker-compose changes**

I’m thinking of suggesting a command for the user to run, specifically `docker compose up --build -d`. But what if they already have it running? To be safe, I should update the compose file and instruct them to recreate it instead. I'll use `edit_file/apply_patch` to modify the REDIS_URL variable to reflect the service. I could also add `depends_on`, which is already present. After making the change, I’ll advise the user to restart the service and keep them informed with status updates before and after the edit.</details></think>

---

I'm going to update `docker-compose.yml` so the proxy connects to the Redis service hostname (`redis:6379`) instead of `127.0.0.1:6380`, which isn't reachable from inside the container.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Updating Docker Compose**

I’ve edited the docker-compose environment and need to look into the README instructions and possibly the Dockerfile, though it seems like a minimal fix. I should suggest running `docker compose up --build`. For this, I’ll provide a brief status update since we've made an edit, but there's no need for a todo. The docker-compose file isn't linted, so I'll propose a rebuild command like `docker compose up -d --build`, ensuring port mapping for Redis remains intact. I’ll summarize these changes concisely.
**Outlining Next Steps**

I’ve made a code edit, and rather than dumping code, I used `apply_patch`. Now I need to provide a brief outline of the next steps. It’s important to keep this concise and clear for anyone who needs to follow along. I want to make sure they understand what changes were made and what actions they need to take next. Keeping it straightforward will help everyone stay on the same page moving forward!</details></think>

- I see the container is trying to reach Redis at 127.0.0.1:6380, which won’t work from inside the `proxy` container. I updated `docker-compose.yml` so `REDIS_URL` points to the Docker service hostname `redis:6379`.

Next, rebuild and restart the stack:
```bash
docker compose down && docker compose up -d --build
```

If you still want Redis exposed on the host at 6380, the existing port mapping is fine; the proxy will now connect internally to `redis:6379`.

- Changed `docker-compose.yml`: `REDIS_URL` now `redis://redis:6379` so the `proxy` reaches the `redis` service correctly inside Docker.

the issue is that there is already another container running on this port of redis 6379 -

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Resolving Docker Port Conflicts**

I need to adjust the docker-compose to prevent port conflicts. Right now, the redis service is set up to expose port mapping for the host, which is working fine. However, if another container is binding to port 6379 on the host, we could run into trouble. It looks like the other container is using the same hostname and port. I need to check if there’s a second redis container in the same network setup that's causing this issue.
**Analyzing Redis Connection Issues**

The proxy connects to the redis service on port 6379 within its own compose network, which shouldn't cause conflicts. However, if someone runs the proxy without the redis service in that network, it might try to resolve the hostname externally, leading to issues. A possible solution is to parameterize the internal redis port to 6380, allowing the redis container to listen there instead. Since compose maps the redis service to host port 6380, the conflict may come from another container binding to port 6379 within the docker network, but that shouldn't affect our setup.
**Clarifying Redis Connection Setup**

It sounds like there might be another redis instance running on the same network, which could be causing confusion due to identical container names or ports. A simple fix would be to rename the service to `overpass-redis` and update the REDIS_URL to point to `redis://overpass-redis:6379`. The compose file usually isolates services, but if they're running a standalone Redis on the host, they'd need to adjust the REDIS_URL accordingly. However, using `127.0.0.1` within a container refers to the container itself, not the host. They could use `host.docker.internal` for Mac/Win or configure Linux accordingly.
**Providing Docker Solutions**

The good news is that Docker isolates ports, meaning conflicts mainly occur on the host. If there are concerns, renaming the service could help. I see two options: 

1. Keep the internal port 6379 and change the service name if there's a clash.
2. If the proxy needs to connect to an external Redis instance, update the REDIS_URL to `redis://host.docker.internal:6379` and add `extra_hosts` for Linux configurations. 

Since the user likely prefers using the existing Redis instead of launching another, let's suggest both options and implement the user's choice while following the instructions to keep moving until we resolve the issue.
**Clarifying Redis Configuration**

I think we can go ahead using the internal service while giving it a unique name to prevent any confusion. The current compose setup already maps the host port to 6380, which avoids conflicts, so there shouldn’t be a problem. I’ll explain that Docker is isolated, with the internal redis being at `redis:6379` and the host binding at `127.0.0.1:6380`. If the user wants to use their existing Redis on port 6379, they can set the REDIS_URL to `redis://host.docker.internal:6379`, add extra_hosts for Linux, and remove the redis service if needed.</details></think>

- Inside Docker, port 6379 is internal to each Redis container and doesn’t conflict with other stacks. Your compose already exposes Redis on the host as 6380, so it won’t clash with a different host Redis on 6379. The proxy will talk to `redis:6379` over the internal network, which is fine.

If you want the proxy to use your existing host Redis on 6379 instead of the bundled one:
- Change the env and add host mapping (Linux):
```yaml
services:
  proxy:
    environment:
      PORT: 8080
      UPSTREAM_URL: https://overpass.miataru.com/api/interpreter
      REDIS_URL: redis://host.docker.internal:6379
    extra_hosts:
      - host.docker.internal:host-gateway
# Remove the `redis:` service block entirely
```
Then:
```bash
docker compose down && docker compose up -d --build
```

Otherwise, keep the current setup; just rebuild after the `REDIS_URL` fix and you’ll be good.
