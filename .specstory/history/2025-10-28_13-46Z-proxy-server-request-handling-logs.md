_**Assistant (default)**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Diagnosing Bad Request Error**

I see that we're getting a 400 Bad Request error from overpass.miataru.com, likely due to incorrect bounding box coordinates. The input seems to have latitude and longitude in the wrong order. Overpass expects south, west, north, and east (S,W,N,E), but the coordinates are given as lat, lat, lon, lon. I’ll correct the order and inspect the relevant files in the codebase to resolve the issue. Let's proceed with that search!</details></think>

---

I'll search the codebase to see how the Overpass query body is assembled and where the bbox coordinates are placed, to fix the 400 Bad Request caused by an incorrect bbox order.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Evaluating bbox order**

I'm checking the logs that show a 400 error from upstream Overpass. The code indicates that buildTileQuery uses the bbox coordinates in the correct order, which should be south, west, north, east. However, the logs present a mix-up: the second value is latitude instead of longitude. It seems like the values are incorrectly formatted as two latitudes followed by two longitudes. I suspect there might be issues in the tiling code with how bbox components are mixed up. I’ll look into bbox.ts and tiling.ts for clarity.</details></think>

---

I'll search where bounding boxes and tile bounds are computed to see if latitude/longitude ordering is mixed, since the upstream query shows lat/lat/lon/lon instead of south,west,north,east.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Investigating bounding box issue**

I’m looking into the buildTileQuery in upstream.ts, where it correctly uses bbox.south, west, north, east. However, there's an error indicating that lat/lat/lon/lon is duplicated. The URL-encoded body shows values like 22.4121, 22.3681 for latitude, and 112.6757, 112.6318 for longitude, but they’re in the wrong order. Overpass expects the format to be south, west, north, east. It looks like I need to check the implementation in src/tiling.ts for the decode process.</details></think>

---

I'll open `src/tiling.ts` and `src/upstream.ts` to inspect the exact implementations of `decode` and `fetchTile`, since the bbox ordering seems correct in the template but may be wrong in `decode`.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Fixing tile query issue**

I’m currently realizing that the `buildTileQuery` function is using the `bbox` incorrectly from `tile.bounds`. It seems that the bounds are computed wrongly, with the 'south' variable mistakenly set to the max latitude. This would cause problems since it would lead to incorrect latitude values. I’ll need to change the destructuring order in the code and then edit `src/tiling.ts`. Since this is a simple fix, I should be able to update the code quickly without any additional todos.
**Proposing hotfix process**

I've discovered that the source logs are from TypeScript compilation, and it looks like the container may work from the `dist` directory. I should edit the `src/tiling.ts` file first and rebuild it. Since the user's environment is using Docker Compose, we can't run the build directly but can propose commands to rebuild and restart the container.

I’ll suggest using `docker compose up --build -d`. After applying the edits, I’ll propose the Docker command for rebuilding. We can also run unit tests with `npm test` to ensure everything works. Let's proceed with these changes!
**Planning rebuild and testing**

I’ve decided not to modify the `dist` directory directly since it’s better to rebuild. I should use the tools available: first, I’ll apply the necessary patch, then I’ll need to run `docker compose build`. Since we’re on the user’s machine, I can use `run_terminal_cmd` to navigate to the project directory and run `npm test`, followed by `docker compose up --build -d`. Let's go ahead and implement these changes!</details></think>

---

I'll fix the incorrect bbox destructuring in `src/tiling.ts`, then run tests and rebuild the container to verify the 400 error is resolved.

---

I searched for where the Overpass query is built and how tile bounds are computed. I found that `ngeohash.decode_bbox` was destructured in the wrong order, causing incorrect bbox coordinates to be sent upstream. I'll correct the destructuring, then check for lint errors.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Checking for updates and tests**

I see that we made an edit, but it seems we didn’t create any TODOs. The developer instructions suggest using a TODO list for multi-step tasks, but this feels like a simple fix. I should suggest running tests or a build next. Maybe I can propose a command to run unit tests and rebuild the Docker. I’ll look into running `npm test` since the workspace likely has scripts. Let's check the package.json for details!</details></think>

---

I'll run the test suite to verify the fix and then rebuild the Docker image to ensure the change works in the container.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Providing deployment instructions**

I've fixed the code and tests, but since Docker isn't available in this environment, the user is probably running Docker Compose. I need to provide clear steps for rebuilding and redeploying the system to resolve the 400 error. I'll need to summarize these steps concisely, including the status updates. The fix involved swapping the destructuring order for coordinates. Now, I'll guide the user on pulling the latest image and how to confirm everything with the logs.</details></think>

---

I found the bug: `ngeohash.decode_bbox` was destructured in the wrong order, producing invalid bbox coordinates for upstream. I corrected it and all tests pass locally.

What I changed
- Fixed bbox order in `src/tiling.ts`:
```12:16:/home/bietiekay/code/ToiletFinder/overpass-proxy/src/tiling.ts
const decode = (hash: string): BoundingBox => {
  const [south, west, north, east] = ngeohash.decode_bbox(hash);
  return { south, west, north, east };
};
```

How to deploy the fix
- Rebuild TypeScript:
```bash
cd /home/bietiekay/code/ToiletFinder/overpass-proxy
npm run build
```
- Rebuild and restart with Docker (run these on the machine that has Docker):
```bash
docker compose build --no-cache
docker compose up -d
```

What to expect
- The upstream Overpass request body will now include bbox as `south,west,north,east`, matching Overpass’ expected order.
- Your 400 Bad Request on cacheable tile fetches should be resolved. Watch the logs for successful 200 responses after “cacheable request with bbox”.

If Docker isn’t available on this host (as shown by “docker: command not found”), run the Docker commands on your deployment server, or start the proxy locally with:
```bash
npm run dev
```

- Fixed incorrect bbox decode; queries now use correct south,west,north,east order.
- Tests (unit + integration) all pass (27/27).

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Committing changes**

It seems like they want to describe and commit changes, likely a git commit with a message. I need to stage those changes and commit via the terminal while providing a brief status update. There doesn’t seem to be a todo list since it’s pretty simple. I’ll run `git diff` to check the changes and then commit with a message about fixing the bbox decode order to resolve 400 errors using the absolute path for the commands.</details></think>

---

I'll stage the change, write a concise commit message describing the bbox decode order fix and its impact, and commit it.

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Summarizing task completion**

I need to confirm that we've completed the commit and provide a brief description. Following the todo tool guidelines, it may be ideal for multi-step tasks, but this was straightforward with actions like editing, testing, and committing. The system suggests using todos, but I can skip it for simple tasks. I’ll include a status update as per spec, mention the commit hash, and maybe add instructions on how to redeploy, keeping everything concise.</details></think>

- Committed fix for bbox decode order in `src/tiling.ts` to use `[south, west, north, east]`.
- This resolves 400 Bad Request from upstream by sending correct tile bounds.
- All tests pass (27/27).

Commit:
- Hash: d2d9636
- Message: tiling: fix ngeohash.decode_bbox order to south,west,north,east

Deployment reminder:
- Build: `npm run build`
- Docker: `docker compose build --no-cache && docker compose up -d` (on a host with Docker)
